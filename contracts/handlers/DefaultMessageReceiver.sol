        @notice Users have to understand the design and limitations behind the Actions processing.
        The contract will try to return all the leftover tokens and native token to the
        receiver address. This logic is applied to the native token if there was a balance
        increase during the message processing, then to the tokenSent which is received from
        Sygma proposal and finally to every Action.tokenReceive. In the vast majority of
        cases that would be enough, though user can come up with a scenario where an Action
        produces results in a receival of more than one token, while only one could be
        specified in this particular Action.tokenReceive property. In such a case it is
        a users responsibility to either send it all with a transferBalanceAction() Action or to
        include an extra action[s] with tokenReceive set to each of the tokens received.
